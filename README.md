# WikiModule
Work with the wiki pages the easiest way.

This module allows you to create an instance of a wiki page object, and get the link, name, and content of the article.

Also, you can create an instance of a random wiki page object, which represents a random article whenever it's created.
You can easily find a new random article using the .randomize() method.
